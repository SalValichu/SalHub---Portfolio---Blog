# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:


## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript with type-aware lint rules enabled. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) for information on how to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project.


## Suggested Enhancements

- Upgrade Nav and Footer with glassmorphism, icons, and hover effects
- Add animated transitions between pages
- Use cards and grids for Blog and Portfolio pages
- Add loading skeletons and micro-interactions
- Use custom fonts for headings and body
- Add a global background with gradients or subtle patterns
- Add a toast notification system for user feedback
- Add a profile dropdown and avatar in the header
- Add a search bar and quick links

See `src/components` and `src/pages` for where to apply these changes.
